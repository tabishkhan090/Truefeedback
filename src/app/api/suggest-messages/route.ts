Create a list of three open-ended and engaging questions formatted as a single string.
Each question should be separated by '||'.

These questions are for an anonymous social messaging platform like Qooh.me and should be suitable for a diverse audience.

Avoid personal or sensitive topics.
Focus on universal themes that encourage friendly interaction.

Example format:
"What’s a hobby you’ve recently started?||If you could have dinner with any historical figure, who would it be?||What’s a simple thing that makes you happy?"

Ensure the questions are intriguing, positive, and welcoming.
